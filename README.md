### About me
Hello 👋 I’m Filip

I’m a data analyst/engineer on a continuous learning journey. I transitioned from economics and management into the world of data — and I love exploring this landscape.  
I value clean structure, meaningful projects, and impactful solutions.

### Current focus
I’m currently solidifying my Python and SQL skills on DataCamp to put them together for some small personal projects.  
I’m also eager to learn how to utilize AI and become more AI literate.

### Skills & tools
**Languages**: Python, SQL  
**Tools**: Keboola, Deepnote
